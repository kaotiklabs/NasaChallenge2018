# NasaChallenge2018

This is our project for NASA Apps Challenge 2018.

Is a 3D global data Earth viewer.
It uses javascript, p5.js and simpleheatmap.js.

Data is parsed from a .csv file, cleaned and transformed to 3D and send it to the texturer.
Textures are build using lat, lon coordinates and their magnitude.
A heatmap is generated for each date and exported as a png texure.
The heatmap is projected over a 3D model of the Earth and the animation is shown.

All has been done in one long day by a team of two.
Hope you enjoy. :)
